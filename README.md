# Zepher for PHP

Zepher manages application access control configurations online, and produces an optimized, JSON object for use in your existing codebase.

The JSON object contains pre-configured values from complex relationship computations. As a result, simple functions can be used to incorporate extremely useful functionality into your existing codebase.
